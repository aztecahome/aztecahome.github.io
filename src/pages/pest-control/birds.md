## Your Sentry Against Winged Intruders

Arizona's bird diversity is a sight to behold, but when these feathered creatures decide to roost or nest in or around our homes, particularly in Phoenix, they can become a nuisance. From noisy disturbances to property damage, the challenges they present are diverse. AZTECA Home Services is your committed ally in ensuring your home remains a bird-free sanctuary!

## Keeping Phoenix Homes Bird-Free

Dealing with bird issues in Arizona demands a thoughtful, humane approach. AZTECA Home Services is your dependable partner, offering comprehensive inspections, preventive recommendations, and humanely implemented control measures to deter bird presence.

### Appreciating the Bird Dilemma

Birds, in search of food and nesting spots, are often attracted to our homes. Their droppings can be unsightly and damaging to property, and some species can be particularly noisy or aggressive, especially during nesting season.

### Our Bird Deterrence Approach

Our approach involves making your home unappealing to birds, using bird-proofing methods, and where necessary, safely relocating nests to more suitable habitats.

- **Bird-Proofing**: This includes installing bird spikes, nets, or other deterrents to prevent birds from roosting or nesting on your property.
- **Safe Nest Relocation**: We collaborate with local wildlife agencies to safely and humanely relocate nests, adhering to regulations protecting certain bird species.

Post-intervention, you may notice some lingering bird activity, but this should decrease significantly as the birds recognize the changes to their previous roosting or nesting sites.

### Staying a Flight Ahead of Birds

Regularly cleaning your outdoor areas, securely covering trash cans, and removing access to food sources can help deter birds. Be aware that some bird species are protected, and their nests cannot be disturbed during certain periods.

At AZTECA Home Services, we're dedicated to providing humane, effective solutions to your pest problems. Should you require additional assistance between scheduled visits or if you're not entirely satisfied, we're just a call away, ready to serve at no additional charge.

### Establishing a Bird Barrier

- Keep outdoor dining areas clean and secure trash cans to reduce available food sources.

### Bird-Proofing Your Home

- Regular inspections of your property can help identify potential roosting or nesting sites, which can then be bird-proofed.
